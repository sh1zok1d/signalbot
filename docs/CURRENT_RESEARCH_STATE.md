# Signalbot — Current Research State

**Status date:** 2026-09-21  
**Status:** `ACTIVE / CANONICAL ROUTING INDEX`  
**Main integration baseline before this status commit:** `b25d9ca99498630183813d0ccb8c6d67b93ad915`

This file is the compact answer to “what controls the project now?”. Frozen preregistrations/results remain authoritative for reproducing their own experiments; this file controls current routing only.

Program-level correction is sealed in `docs/research/MARKET_PROGRAM_UPDATE_POST_M06.*`: MARKET-01 is **not** in the exact M05/M06 cell. The exact cell is repeated-null / low-priority-for-now; the broader short-horizon BTC conditional scalar-prediction family is low-priority / saturated-for-now as a search-priority judgement.

## Exact next unit

```
PREVIOUS_ROUTING            = STRUCTURAL_REGIME_STATE_DETECTION_MECHANISM_CLASS_AND_NULL_MODEL_FEASIBILITY
PREVIOUS_ROUTING_SUPERSEDED = true
R_A_CURRENT_STATUS          = DISCOVERY_SPRINT_01_D1
MARKET_07_CREATED           = false
NEXT_UNIT                   = DISCOVERY_SPRINT_01_EXECUTION
PROTECTED_2025_OPENED       = false
PROTECTED_2026_OPENED       = false
```

All six Discovery Sprint 01 cards (D1-D6) were converted to frozen
`EXECUTABLE_DISCOVERY_SPEC` records (none deferred) by
`DISCOVERY_SPRINT_01_SPEC_COMPILATION`, recorded in
`docs/research/DISCOVERY_SPRINT_01_SPEC_COMPILATION.{json,md}`. That unit
is an outcome-blind spec freeze, not a confirmatory lifecycle: no ARM, no
claim/reservation, no one-shot execution authority. No discovery outcome
has been computed and no candidate performance has been inspected.

The orthogonal-region selection is recorded in
`docs/research/MARKET_NEXT_HYPOTHESIS_SELECTION.{json,md}` (commit
`a711086c36eb7129fc3f0660732049de93dd1629`) and remains a valid historical
record: R-A was chosen because it materially changes the FUNCTION axis
(scalar outcome prediction -> state detection), does not rescue
MARKET-05/06, and is feasible with existing point-in-time price data. That
selection is **preserved, not retracted**.

A later, separate program-level decision recorded in
`docs/research/HYPOTHESIS_DISCOVERY_PIPELINE_V2.{json,md}` and
`docs/research/DISCOVERY_SPRINT_01.{json,md}` **supersedes only the
routing** that followed from a711086 (i.e. turning R-A directly into the
next confirmatory research unit). Signalbot has strong
falsification/validation machinery but `INTERNAL_PROMISING_PROTOTYPES = 0`
across MARKET-01/02/05/06; MARKET-03 is external reproduction, not internal
discovery. R-A is therefore reclassified as `DISCOVERY_SPRINT_01 / D1 =
STRUCTURAL_STATE_DETECTION`: it is explored first as one of six cheap,
outcome-inspecting, non-evidentiary discovery cards (D1-D6), not
immediately preregistered as a confirmatory hypothesis. R-A's null-model
risk (surrogate/null must preserve lower-order structure, chosen
outcome-blind) carries over unchanged into card D1.

a711086's statement that R-B and R-F "need a fresh evaluation surface that
does not exist" is now scoped to **confirmatory** use only.
`DISCOVERY_FEASIBILITY != CONFIRMATORY_FEASIBILITY`: both may be explored
under adaptive discovery on historically exposed 2020-2024 data (cards D2
and D5 respectively), but any resulting pattern remains exploratory and
requires an independent future confirmation surface, and D5 (R-F) carries
an explicitly recorded HIGH rescue/multiple-testing risk. R-C is still the
most orthogonal region but has no panel data and no listing/delisting
reconstruction (see the `CROSS_SECTIONAL_PANEL_FEASIBILITY` sidecar in
`DISCOVERY_SPRINT_01`). R-D and R-E remain forward-collection only.

Do not create MARKET-07. `DISCOVERY_SPRINT_01_CARD_EXECUTION` must stop and
require a program-level decision if, after 6-10 materially orthogonal
internal discovery cards, `INTERNAL_PROMISING_PROTOTYPES == 0`.

### Historical surface exposure

2020-2024 is a **historically exposed/adapted program research surface**:
H01/H02 and further H/BATCH work adapted on 2020-02-01 -> 2025-01-01 with
outcome inspection allowed, and MARKET-01/02/05/06 consumed confirmatory
windows inside it. A chronological split inside 2020-2024 must be called
"chronological held-out evaluation on historically exposed research data",
never out-of-sample or independent confirmation. The earlier claim that
2020-2021 was unconsumed is retracted.

## Hard boundaries

- no MARKET-05 or MARKET-06 rescue, sign flip, venue swap, threshold tweak, horizon tweak, or rerun;
- no opening protected 2025/2026 merely to search for a survivor;
- no V4;
- B2-06 remains blocked;
- product build remains frozen until evidence justifies a concrete restart.
